# Homework 1 AI Synthesis Activity

Only complete one of the assignments below! You can delete the other assignment in this document once you've made your choice.

## Activity: You used AI 
### Part 1
> Cite the usage by including screenshots, a text transcript, or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the conversations you had with the AI.
I used ChatGPT to help with this homework. I shared the assignment instructions and my starter file, and then asked questions whenever I got stuck. I included screenshots of the conversation in the ai-screenshots folder.
### Part 2
> Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adequate? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?
I used AI because I wasnâ€™t sure how to implement some parts of the assignment on my own. Searching online felt slower and less clear, so ChatGPT helped me quickly get working answers and explanations.
### Part 3
> Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?
The responses were accurate and helpful. For example, when I asked about cleaning the data, ChatGPT gave me code that worked right away. I only had to adjust small things like file paths. Overall, the answers were clear and did not make up details.
### Part 4
> If you used unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI within your assignment, be sure to research them and explain what those concepts are to demonstrate your understanding.
Some things were new to me, like converting strings into numbers and dates, and using reduce to find maximum values. I looked these up to understand them better, and now I know why they were needed in this assignment.
